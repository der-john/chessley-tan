This folder contains Erik Bern's original Deep Pink, written in Theano. This is
to be used during project submission IF AND ONLY IF I have failed in creating a
working TensorFlow port by the due date. Bern's Deep Pink will be used for the
Chessley's initial builds, until at some point I succeed in fixing the
TensorFlow port, as I will continue working on the project in the future.

Installing Theano:

```
$ pip install Theano
```

A Virtual Env will be included inside the build for portability.
