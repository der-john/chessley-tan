Train an AI to play chess, and have your AI compete with other people's AIs! Named after https://github.com/ChesleyTan

## About

This project was made for a Software Development class at Stuyvesant High
School.

Upon making an account, users will be given a baby AI with almost no knowledge
of chess other than the rules. Players will train the AI to improve its skills,
and the players will be ranked based on an ELO ranking system. Players gain ELO
when their AI defeats another player's AI in a competitive match.
